# Components

Components in this section are part of the `leptos_forge_ui_components` library and are specifically designed 
for use within `leptos_forge` and **control panels** of your widgets. They allow you to build control 
interfaces without tying `leptos_forge` to any particular UI framework beyond `leptos`, giving you flexibility 
to choose your preferred UI library elsewhere in your application.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> Please don't treat the documentation of components in this section and it's subpages as remotely "good".
> We are planning to make this documentation presentable but it takes time to get here, since documentation
> for basic concepts is still under development. 
>
> After finishing these GH tickets we will take a serious effort to revamp this corner of documentation:
>
> - [Core documentation](https://github.com/mskorkowski/leptos-forge/issues/3)
> - [Better UX/UI](https://github.com/mskorkowski/leptos-forge/issues/9)
> - [Better DX](https://github.com/mskorkowski/leptos-forge/issues/23)

> [!NOTE]
> 
> **Usage Restriction:** These components are **only intended for use in `leptos_forge`-based applications`** 
> especially the control panels for your components and `leptos_forge` itself.
>
> If you use these components outside of this scope, you bind yourself to a specific version of `leptos_forge`

# `leptos_forge` - Leptos utils

This crate contains utilities which were created as a part of the `leptos_forge` project but
might be useful for other projects/applications too.

Using it directly in your web application is fine. 

## Available utilities

- Functions to add/remove css class from the NodeRef
- Generic RWSignal
- Struct which makes it trivial to store NodeRef's in the reactive Store

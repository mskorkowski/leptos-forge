# Leptos Forge utils

Library with utilities used across the Leptos Forge project. The code here is generic and 
not specific to any particular use case.

> **Warning**
>
> The `proptest` feature (and related code) will probably be removed from this crate in 
> the future. It's here because historically this code was part of my private projects
> and while publishing the Leptos Forge, I was trying to reduce amount of work to do.
